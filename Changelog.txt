CAMPAIGN

General:
- Added cooperative support to all SP missions.

	- In cooperative, this will be an option as part of the lobby when you host.
	- In SP mode, this will be controlled by the difficulty option in your options.
- Subtitles added to all mission-critical dialogue. 
- Immersion improved. Logic has been added to try and combat the odds of a player seeing an enemy/ally spawn in from nowhere (common BZ2/BZCC issue in Stock).
- Cutscenes removed if mission is in cooperative mode. (MP doesn't support cutscene logic for clients, and would only fire for the host).

ISDF01 (This is not a Drill):
- Added third Dropship for extra players.
- Added extra sound effect to the cliff when it's finished crumbling and hits the ground.
- Fixed code where the rest of Red Squad are meant to look at your team while they wait for you to catch up.

- Reduced intensity of sounds during the dropship cutscene.

- Replaced Guardian turrets from the training variant to the normal variant.
- Updated Shabayev's pilot to use the new `isshab_p` ODF.
- When attacking the second Jammer, Shabayev's broken radio dialog will repeat until the Jammer is destroyed. Before, it only played once.
- Fixed first path for Shabayev so she doesn't run into the communications building when she's leaving.
- Fixed missing construction sounds on the Scion builder.
- During the final part of the mission, there is a Sentry that sits in the base when Shabayev is in the Constructor. That has been made smarter and will attack when Shabayev enters the base perimeter.
- Reduced times for warnings if the player isn't following orders.
- All Scion Units are classified as "Unknown" to line up with post-mission debriefings.

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements.

ISDF03 (We Have Hostiles):

- First Hauler is unkillable until it exits the tunnels. This is to make sure there's no funky behaviour with other units if a relic is placed in the tunnel.

	- isdf0318.wav
	- isdf0320.wav

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements.

ISDF04 (Too Hot):
- Slight adjustment to the logic where Shabayev builds the first turret. Scrap is given when the first Scion wave attacks, instead of waiting until after they are destroyed. 
	This prevets a lull in the mission, meaning the player won't need to wait as long.
- Recycler has been updated to use new voices. 
- Friendly units will now leave the map before being removed.
- Blue Squad has changed from Scouts to Tanks.
- Added sound effect to the cliff when it crumbles to match ISDF01.

- Fixed a bug where ibpge5 had a Scion sound.

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements.

ISDF06 (The Wormhole):
- Scavengers are now deployed as part of the BZN. It made no sense for a whole ISDF base to be present with no biometal intake.

- Added Constructor to the start of the mission so it doesn't spawn in mid-mission.
- Added Scavenger to the start of the mission so it doesn't spawn in mid-mission.

	- Added a couple of turrets.
- Added Green Squad to support Manson's dialogue about initial attacks and Scavenger discovery.
