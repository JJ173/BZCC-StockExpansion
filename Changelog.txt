CAMPAIGN

General:
- Added cooperative support to all SP missions.
- Improved mission difficulty (enemies spawned, time between events, etc) based on difficulty options.
	- In cooperative, this will be an option as part of the lobby when you host.
	- In SP mode, this will be controlled by the difficulty option in your options.
- Subtitles added to all mission-critical dialogue. 
- Immersion improved. Logic has been added to try and combat the odds of a player seeing an enemy/ally spawn in from nowhere (common BZ2/BZCC issue in Stock).
- Cutscenes removed if mission is in cooperative mode. (MP doesn't support cutscene logic for clients, and would only fire for the host).

ISDF01 (This is not a Drill):
- Added third Dropship for extra players.
- Added extra sound effect to the cliff when it's finished crumbling and hits the ground.
- Fixed code where the rest of Red Squad are meant to look at your team while they wait for you to catch up.
- Added logic to keep the enemies alive that are attacking Simms until the player is within range. 
- Reduced intensity of sounds during the dropship cutscene. 
- Increased intensity of the fight between the Scions and Red Squad.
- Red Squad is no longer killed so easily by the enemy. They have a chance of surviving.
- Surviving Red Squad Pilots or Ships will return to the outpost.
- Reduced times for warnings if the player isn't following orders.
- All Scion Units are classified as "Unknown" to line up with post-mission debriefings.

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements.

ISDF02 (A Simple S & R): 
- Replaced training versions of Sentries with either normal Scion Scouts or normal Scion Sentries based on chosen difficulty.
- Re-added missing "isdf0228.wav" after the first Jammer is destroyed.
- Replaced Guardian turrets from the training variant to the normal variant.
- Updated Shabayev's pilot to use the new `isshab_p` ODF.
- When attacking the second Jammer, Shabayev's broken radio dialog will repeat until the Jammer is destroyed. Before, it only played once.
- Fixed first path for Shabayev so she doesn't run into the communications building when she's leaving.
- Fixed missing construction sounds on the Scion builder.
- During the final part of the mission, there is a Sentry that sits in the base when Shabayev is in the Constructor. That has been made smarter and will attack when Shabayev enters the base perimeter.
- Reduced times for warnings if the player isn't following orders.
- All Scion Units are classified as "Unknown" to line up with post-mission debriefings.

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements.

ISDF03 (We Have Hostiles):
- Improved Shabayev's logic so she should have no issue entering the tunnels.
- First Hauler is unkillable until it exits the tunnels. This is to make sure there's no funky behaviour with other units if a relic is placed in the tunnel.
- Shabayev and Red 1 will now drive off the map before disappearing from the mission.
- Red 1 will now drive to their distress location instead of spawning there.
- All Scion Units are classified as "Unknown" to line up with post-mission debriefings.
- Added a couple of Scion units that chase Shabayev and Red Squad when they are returning to the base.

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements.

ISDF04 (Too Hot):
- Slight adjustment to the logic where Shabayev builds the first turret. Scrap is given when the first Scion wave attacks, instead of waiting until after they are destroyed. 
	This prevets a lull in the mission, meaning the player won't need to wait as long.
- Recycler has been updated to use new voices. 
- Friendly units will now leave the map before being removed.
- Blue Squad has changed from Scouts to Tanks.
- Added sound effect to the cliff when it crumbles to match ISDF01.

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements. 

ISDF05 (The Dark Planet):
- Scion units will now attack the player from multiple angles, rather than spawning in one place and attacking.
- Shabayev will no longer cause mission failure if her Tank is destroyed. Instead she will have the Recycler build a replacement Scout for her to pilot.
	- Mission will fail if her pilot is killed.
- Players now spawn in a "ivtank" instead of using whatever is saved in BZN by the editor.
- Shabayev now spawns in "ivtank" instead of "ivtan5".
- Re-added missing "isdf0501.wav" dialogue to the start of the mission.
- Manson spawns at the start of the mission to reduce the likelihood of players seeing him "pop in".
- Manson is now triggered when the player has successfully deployed the second Scavenger.
- Renamed Power Generator to Power for consistency.
- Renamed Cmdr. Shabayev to Cmd. Shabayev for consistency.
- Constructor now costs 40 scrap instead of being free.
	- This addresses an issue where if they player cancels the free constructor, they are refunded 20 scrap.

- Fixed a bug where ibpge5 had a Scion sound.

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements.

ISDF06 (The Wormhole):

- Added Constructor to the start of the mission so it doesn't spawn in mid-mission.
- Added Scavenger to the start of the mission so it doesn't spawn in mid-mission.
- Moved the "breachers" spawn outside of the map boundaries so the player won't seem their spawn.
- Changes to ISDF base to make it more "alive":

- Added Green Squad to support Manson's dialogue about initial attacks and Scavenger discovery.
	- Green Squad will return to attack the enemy base.

- Starter units now depend on mission difficulty for the player.
- Added a new failure: if a Scout finds your base and your base Jammer is dead, the mission will fail. (This has been done to line up with the idea that enemy units can just radio back to base if their communications aren't being jammed). Make sure to keep your base Jammer alive!
- ISDF base will sound an alarm if you are spotted or it has been alerted.
- ISDF base will send attacks after being alerted during the second phase of the mission.
