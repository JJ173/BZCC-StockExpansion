Campaign:

General:
- Added cooperative support to all SP missions.
- Improved mission difficulty (enemies spawned, time between events, etc) based on difficulty options.
	- In cooperative, this will be an option as part of the lobby when you host.
	- In SP mode, this will be controlled by the difficulty option in your options.
- Subtitles added to all mission-critical dialogue. 
- Immersion improved. Logic has been added to try and combat the odds of a player seeing an enemy/ally spawn in from nowhere (common BZ2/BZCC issue in Stock).
- Cutscenes removed if mission is in cooperative mode. (MP doesn't support cutscene logic for clients, and would only fire for the host).
- Increased ISDF pilot walking animation to look more realistic.
- Added step sound to Scion builder.

ISDF02 (A Simple S & R): 
- Replaced training versions of Sentries with either normal Scion Scouts or normal Scion Sentries based on chosen difficulty.
- Re-added missing "isdf0228.wav" after the first Jammer is destroyed.
- Replaced Guardian turrets from the training variant to the normal variant.
- Updated Shabayev's pilot to use the new `isshab_p` ODF.
- When attacking the second Jammer, Shabayev's broken radio dialog will repeat until the Jammer is destroyed. Before, it only played once.
- Fixed first path for Shabayev so she doesn't run into the communications building when she's leaving.
- Fixed missing construction sounds on the Scion builder.
- During the final part of the mission, there is a Sentry that sits in the base when Shabayev is in the Constructor. That has been made smarter and will attack when Shabayev enters the base perimeter.
- If the player strays away from Shabayev, there are some warnings. The duration between these events has been reduced.

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements.

ISDF05 (The Dark Planet):
- Scion units will now attack the player from multiple angles, rather than spawning in one place and attacking.
- Shabayev will no longer cause mission failure if her Tank is destroyed. Instead she will have the Recycler build a replacement Scout for her to pilot.
	- Mission will fail if her pilot is killed.
- Players now spawn in a "ivtank" instead of using whatever is saved in BZN by the editor.
- Shabayev now spawns in "ivtank" instead of "ivtan5".
- Re-added missing "isdf0501.wav" dialogue to the start of the mission.
- Manson spawns at the start of the mission to reduce the likelihood of players seeing him "pop in".
- Manson is now triggered when the player has successfully deployed the second Scavenger.
- Renamed Power Generator to Power for consistency.
- Renamed Cmdr. Shabayev to Cmd. Shabayev for consistency.
- Constructor now costs 40 scrap instead of being free.
	- This addresses an issue where if they player cancels the free constructor, they are refunded 20 scrap.

- Fixed a bug where players could cancel the constructor build order on the Recycler which would stall the mission.
- Fixed a bug where ibpge5 had a Scion sound.

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements.

ISDF06 (The Wormhole):
- Scavengers are now deployed as part of the BZN. It made no sense for a whole ISDF base to be present with no biometal intake.
- Added Bomber to the start of the mission so it doesn't spawn in mid-mission.
- Added Constructor to the start of the mission so it doesn't spawn in mid-mission.
- Added Scavenger to the start of the mission so it doesn't spawn in mid-mission.
- Moved the "breachers" spawn outside of the map boundaries so the player won't seem their spawn.
- Changes to ISDF base to make it more "alive":
	- Added a couple of turrets.
- Added Green Squad to support Manson's dialogue about initial attacks and Scavenger discovery.
	- Green Squad will return to attack the enemy base.
- Added larger attacks against the Gun Towers at the front of the base to improve the feeling of potential danger.
- All Missile Scouts now have the Shadower Missile instead of just the player.
- Scion units will actively attack the player and the Constructor during the second phase of the mission (where the player has to attack the Scion Extractor).
- Logic added to make sure the player builds their Relay Bunker and Gun Towers within 100 meter of the pool objective.

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements.

ISDF07 ():
- Added a dropship to the start of the mission to simulate landing.
- Shabayev will now wait until directly ordered before moving to the ruins to investigate.
- Players now spawn in a "ivtank" instead of using whatever is saved in BZN by the editor.

- General QOL (Quality of Life) improvements.

Instant Action/MPI:
- CPU will now have a Commander unit.
- CPU will spawn with 1 Scav that is commanded to go straight to the nearest pool to help reduce scrap stalling.
- CPU will now follow a specific set of base paths to construct their bases so they are more strategic.
