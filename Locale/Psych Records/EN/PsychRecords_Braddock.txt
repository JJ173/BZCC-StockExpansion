Birthdate: 03/03/34
Birthplace: Boston, MA, USA
Referring Institution: Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Meyers-Briggs Personality Classification: ESTJ
Intelligence Quotient: 155

Dr. Braddock presents as a classic manifestation of the genius-level
achiever. After performing extremely well at MIT, completing his
undergraduate degree at an early age, he was immediately accepted 
into the Ph.D. research program. There, his facility for applied 
chemistry and physics brought him to the attention of the NSDF, 
after his name appeared on  an article in the Journal of Astrophysics 
regarding the propulsion properties of inorganic elements.

Psychological evaluation reveals a strong sense of drive, a need to 
succeed that could become problematic if left unchecked. Dr. 
Braddock appears to have a strong sense of self-worth and a 
highly-developed Ego.

Though he occasionally chose the objective over the individual in mock
scenario testing, his proven loyalty to the NSDF and his lack of family 
ties makes him a strong candidate for officer promotion.

RECOMMEND.
