Private Cooke's strongest asset at this stage is his enthusiasm.
Though he does have strong family ties, I believe that his curiosity
and innate thirst for knowledge could override any desires that might
keep him earth-bound.

Private Cookie also appears fairly malleable, a quality which could
make him a strong mid-level officer. His patriotism is evident, and
when presented with ethical dilemmas, he seems adept at pinpointing
the result that's best for the ISDF collective.

RECOMMEND.
