Subject: Lieutenant Henry Manson
Birthdate: 06/12/59
Birthplace: Lubbock, TX, USA
Referring Institution: U.S. Navy Seals

Meyers-Briggs Personality Classification: ENTJ
Intelligence Quotient: 125

Lt. Manson was recruited to the ISDF by Colonel Braddock and 
referred by Major Shemin of the U.S Navy Seals after his 
extraordinary work on undercover operations in Iran.

He presents as a good candidate for ISDF officer promotion, 
mainly due to his strong loyalty and sense of duty. Lt. Manson 
does have some past psychological issues (the premature death 
of a parent and sibling), but he seems to have adjusted to 
military life quite well. He refers to his squad as his 
"family," and consistently mentions his missions, his 
colleagues, and his country when faced with the Rorschach test.

Though he perhaps has not steeled himself to the possibility of 
death and disaster as well as he should, Lt. Manson is still a 
strong candidate for ISDF secret operations, due to his strong 
loyalty and sense of duty.

RECOMMEND.
