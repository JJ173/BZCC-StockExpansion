Date of examination: 07/16/94

Subject: Yelena Shabayev
Birthdate: 11/11/69
Birthplace: St Petersburg, Russia
Referring Institution: FSB/CIA

Meyers-Briggs Personality Classification: ISFJ
Intelligence Quotient: 165

Yelena Shabayev was referred to the ISDF after performing 
undercover operations for the FSB and infiltrating the highest 
levels of the CIA. Punishment at this stage would only waste 
her talents. Recruitment is the preferred option.

Ms. Shabayev presents as a qualified candidate, a strong inquisitor 
and researcher with genius-level IQ. She seems particularly 
concerned with regulations and record-keeping, and adverse to the 
guerrilla tactics of some of her colleagues.

Ms. Shabayev does seem somewhat overly concerned with keeping 
procedures "by the book," which may result in poor decision-making 
skills in the heat of combat. She also may be a liability with 
top-secret information, as her  sense of justice seems overdeveloped. 
But she is a fierce competitor and a highly-intelligent achiever.

If her loyalty can be completed assured, then Ms. Shabayev is 
remarkable candidate for the ISDF.

RECOMMEND.
