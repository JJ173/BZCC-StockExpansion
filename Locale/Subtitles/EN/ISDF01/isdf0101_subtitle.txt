Alright men, there's a lost outpost out there and we're going to find it.
As your commander you will see I am highlighted on your HUD and on your radar.
This will make it easier for you to stay close to me, since the terrain here
on Pluto may be treacherous. I want us to stay in tight formation at all times.
