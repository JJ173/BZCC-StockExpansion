Braddock
Lieutenant, this is General Braddock in carrier orbit, we've got your situation on radar. 
Listen to me carefully. The enemy is trying to confiscate two ISDF crates located in a 
northern hanger at that base. Those crates contain sensitive hardware, Lieutenant. Do 
not let them fall into the hands of the enemy. This is vitally important. Use any means necessary.
