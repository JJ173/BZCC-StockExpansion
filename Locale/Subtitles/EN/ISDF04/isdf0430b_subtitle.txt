Braddock
Alright Lieutenant, you've just become the key part of this little operation. The sniper rifle you 
picked up has been modified to fire a tracer round. It plants a bug, not a bullet. Green and Blue 
squads have cut off the enemies lines of retreat and are forcing them through your location any 
second now. When the enemy moves through, fire a single tracer into one of their craft. 
Fire it into their canopy to disable the occupant of the craft. Get ready Lieutenant, 
you only have a small window of opportunity. Make your shot count.
