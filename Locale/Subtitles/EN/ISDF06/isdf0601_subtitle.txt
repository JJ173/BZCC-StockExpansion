Okay Orange Squad, this base is vital to Green Squad's initial attack. Be ready to face the enemy
but do not join the battle. Stay back in reserve, and keep the Scions from flanking Green Squad's
position. If Green Squad can't break through, you'll have to help spearhead the counter-attack.
Remember, keep your forces back from the main attack as much as you can.
