We won't last long in this shelter, Lieutenant. It's not stable and the area's swarming
with Scions. They're jamming our transmissions so I can't radio out. You've got to go yourself
and get Manson to help. I've got a data collector you need to bring him, it holds a signature
of a Scion power source I've detected in the area. Manson will be able to get a position on it.
By the looks of this something's got to be around here, and it's got to be big.
