Braddock
Attention all ISDF forces of the second fleet. This is General Braddock. You men are to be 
commended for your initiativeand your actions. The sinister Scion objective is now staggeringly 
clear; destruction of your home, destruction of Earth.
Our scientists have analysed the energy signature of this structure and have confirmed my 
disturbing suspicions. It is part of a weapon. Just one part of a weapon of such size and power, 
it could destroy Earth in one quick and irrevocable strike. But now that we know their plans, and 
have their machine, we can track down the other components to this weapon and stop their insidious plans.
