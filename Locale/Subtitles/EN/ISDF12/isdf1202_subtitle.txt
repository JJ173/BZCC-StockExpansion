They just keep coming, Lieutenant! My orders were to take out that second weapon machine at the
alien base, but I don't have enough power to support all these buildings and I only have one 
Scavenger left! I'm turning my men over to you, Cooke. Let's get this base back online so we 
can take out that weapon machine!
