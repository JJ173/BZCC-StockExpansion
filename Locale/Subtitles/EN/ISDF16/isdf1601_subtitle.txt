The heart of this planet is the heart of the Scions. If we shut it down, they are finished. First, 
we'll need to get under the surface and inside the planet. There is a main tunnel artery on the 
surface that will allow us into the planet's infrastructure. The entrance to this artery will be 
heavily guarded though. Locate the entrance and destroy any opposition you may encounter.
