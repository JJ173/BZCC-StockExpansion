C.M Michaelson
Coilmaster Michaelson here, on station aboard the Ark II. I'll be your uplink from orbit. 
You made it through clean! Good. Your first priority is to construct a Portal structure.
We need a stable connection to the Ark II. Until that link is active, you're 
alone out there, Commander.
