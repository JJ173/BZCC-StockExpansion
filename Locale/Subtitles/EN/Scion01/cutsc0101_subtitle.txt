Cooke
The Scions gave me the same gift they gave Yelena, fusing my human body with biometal.
It's impossible to describe the sensations that rushed from my head to my toes. It was
as if they opened a window I never knew was there. I suddenly knew things, I felt things,
I could do things I never could before. It was awesome, but unsettling ... and a small 
part of me longed for the simple regimented life that had once been enough.
