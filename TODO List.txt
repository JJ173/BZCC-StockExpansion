Note idea from Blue: Make a new MPI mode that is "Base Recovery". 2 Enemy bases on the map, 1 is a full CPU base, the other is a partially destroyed human base. Idea: have players spawn on outskirts of base (or at a dropship area with snipers) they have to snipe enemy units and clear the base to regain control of the Recycler, and then destroy the enemy.
